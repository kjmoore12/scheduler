# Project 3 Scheduler Recreated Using Rust
### By Kenneth Moore

This program is formatted to function exactly as my Project 3 program that was written in C++ does. It is able to perform the four algorithms: First-In First-Out (FIFO), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Time To Complete First (STCF), and Round Robin (RR).
The code itself is split across 3 .rs files, in an attempt to mimic the structure from the C++ project. However, header files are not used, so the structs are defined directly in a .rs file.
